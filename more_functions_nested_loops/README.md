# More Functions, More Nested Loops

This project is part of the low-level programming curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on writing additional functions and exploring nested loops in C.

## üìå Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use nested loops
- Create and use custom functions
- Distinguish between function declaration and definition
- Use header files effectively
- Apply logical, relational, and arithmetic operators
- Write C code using the Betty style guide
