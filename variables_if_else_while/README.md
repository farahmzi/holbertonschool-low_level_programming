# 0-positive_or_negative.c

This program assigns a random integer to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

## üß† Description

The program uses the `rand()` function to generate a pseudo-random number. Based on the value of `n`, it prints:

- "`n` is positive" if the number is greater than 0
- "`n` is zero" if the number equals 0
- "`n` is negative" if the number is less than 0

The logic is implemented using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You are not required to understand `srand`, `time`, or `RAND_MAX`.
