# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## 📋 Description

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to practice and understand:

- What pointers are and how to use them
- The difference between arrays and pointers
- How to manipulate strings and arrays with pointers
- Basic memory manipulation in C

## 🛠️ Files and Prototypes

Each file contains specific functions.  
All function prototypes are in `main.h`.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0-reset_to_98.c | Updates the value of an int to 98 |
| 1-swap.c | Swaps the values of two integers |
| 2-strlen.c | Returns the length of a string |
| 3-puts.c | Prints a string followed by a new line |
| 4-print_rev.c | Prints a string in reverse |
| 5-rev_string.c | Reverses a string |
| 6-puts2.c | Prints every other character of a string |
| 7-puts_half.c | Prints half of a string |
| 8-print_array.c | Prints elements of an array of integers |
| 9-strcpy.c | Copies the string pointed to by src |
| 100-atoi.c | Converts a string to an integer |
| 101-keygen.c | Generates a random key |
| string manipulation functions | strcat, strncat, strncpy, strcmp, etc. |
| memory functions | memset, memcpy, strchr, strspn, strpbrk, strstr |
| 8-print_chessboard.c | Prints the chessboard |
| 9-print_diagsums.c | Prints the sums of diagonals of a square matrix |
